# memorypool
lock-free memory pool.  I started working on this by forking https://github.com/cacay/MemoryPool.  However, it quickly became aparant that I could not properly modify his design to be lock-free.  Odd bugs kept popping up, and it was clear to me that threads were stepping on each other.  So, I ripped everything out of his design, and started over.  What's left is just his function names.  Everything else has been completely redesigned.  However, due to the lock-free nature of my code, it's significantly slower than his code.  So, in conclusion, if you want a fast memory pool, and aren't interested in thread safety, grab a copy of his code.  If you want something that's thread safe, this should do the trick for you.
